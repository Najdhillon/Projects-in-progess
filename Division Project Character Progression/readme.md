** Division Project : Character Progression

---

Creating a website for current stats in the game and show progression of my progression

---

*** Requirements:

1. Display each item that is equipped
2. Display all mods being equipped
3. Show all stats that involve firearms, stamina, and electronics
4. Show an image of current image of the avatar

*** Resolution:

Create an html page with the images and display all stats of current character. The plan will be to use different aspect of bootstrap and lightbox. I want to see how creative I can be with limited amount of content.
